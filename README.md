## HOW TO MAKE A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH

Using your favorite authoring tool such as Storyline, Captivate, or any other presentation tool (even Powerpoint is fine), develop a short lesson teaching a high school student how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Assume this student has never seen, tasted, or made this or any other sandwich before.

Make sure to incorporate the following into your lesson:

- [ ] Objectives
- [ ] Interactivity
- [ ] Adaptivity (include more than one pathway for student learning, based on student’s needs and their interactions with the lesson)
 

Your lesson should demonstrate the following:

- [ ] creativity
- [ ] student-engagement
- [ ] intuitive and consistent user experience
- [ ] polished and appealing visual design
- [ ] technical complexity
- [ ] Bonus: accessibility – can you make the lesson adhere to WCAG 2.0?
